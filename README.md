# BuildThisPlease SDK

BuildThisPlease is a hosted feature-request board for Apple apps. This public Swift package provides the iOS client, localized SwiftUI interface, App Attest integration, tests, privacy manifest, and a tiny example app. The Worker, administrator dashboard, database, production configuration, and customer data remain private.

## What app users can do

- Browse and vote on feature requests.
- Submit requests with an optional support email.
- Follow requests created by their installation.
- Exchange approved messages with the app team.
- Read implemented requests without public vote totals.
- Automatically translate user-written content when supported by iOS.

No end-user login is required. BuildThisPlease creates an installation identity, stores its credentials in Keychain, and protects production traffic with Apple App Attest.

## Requirements

- Xcode 26 or newer
- Swift 6.2 or newer
- iOS 17 or newer
- A physical App Attest-capable device for live integration testing

## 1. Create the hosted project

1. Open [feedback.keinois.com](https://feedback.keinois.com).
2. Authenticate through Cloudflare Access.
3. On a new account, wait for the platform operator to approve the signup. An invitation to an existing workspace can also grant access.
4. Create a workspace. A workspace owns projects, collaborators, and exported data.
5. Create a project and enter its name, slug, Apple Team ID, bundle identifier, App Attest environment, and optional notification email.
6. Copy the generated `btp_pk_…` publishable key. It is shown in full only once.

For Debug and App Store builds of the same bundle, register two App identifiers in **Project settings**:

| Build | Team ID | Bundle ID | App Attest environment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Debug on a physical device | Your Apple Team ID | Exact Debug bundle ID | `development` |
| TestFlight/App Store | Your Apple Team ID | Exact Release bundle ID | `production` |

The publishable project key and API URL identify the mobile project; they are not administrator credentials. Never put Cloudflare credentials, dashboard cookies, deployment tokens, database credentials, or private backend source in an app.

## 2. Add the Swift package

In Xcode, choose **File → Add Package Dependencies…** and use:

```text
https://github.com/rosday/BuildThisPleaseSDK
```

Select the `BuildThisPlease` product and a tagged version such as `0.1.0` or newer. Because the package is public, developers and Xcode Cloud do not need access to the private backend repository.

## 3. Enable App Attest

Add the App Attest capability to the host target. Confirm the generated entitlements use `development` for Debug and `production` for Release/TestFlight:

```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.devicecheck.appattest-environment</key>
<string>development</string>
```

The value must match the App identifier registered in the BuildThisPlease dashboard.

App Attest is unavailable in the Simulator. Use `MockBuildThisPleaseClient` for Simulator development and previews. Validate the live service on a physical device before release.

## 4. Configure the client

Create one long-lived client for the app rather than recreating it whenever the view appears:

```swift
import BuildThisPlease
import SwiftUI

let baseURL = URL(string: "https://feedback.keinois.com")!

let environment: BuildThisPleaseConfiguration.Environment = {
    #if DEBUG
    // Uses Apple's development App Attest environment against the live service.
    return .staging(baseURL: baseURL)
    #else
    return .production(baseURL: baseURL)
    #endif
}()

let configuration = try BuildThisPleaseConfiguration(
    projectKey: "btp_pk_your_publishable_project_key",
    environment: environment,
    subscriptionStatus: isTrial ? .trial : (isPro ? .pro : .free),
    revenueCatAppUserID: currentRevenueCatAppUserID,
    userEmail: signedInEmail
)

let feedbackClient = BuildThisPleaseClient(configuration: configuration)
```

`.staging(baseURL:)` selects the `development` App Attest environment; it does not require a separate staging server. Production still rejects Simulator bypass sessions. Release builds must use `.production(baseURL:)`.

`revenueCatAppUserID` and `userEmail` are optional support context. Pass only data your app is permitted to share. When subscription or identity information changes, update the existing client:

```swift
try await feedbackClient.updateSubscriptionStatus(.pro)
try await feedbackClient.updateUserIdentity(
    revenueCatAppUserID: Purchases.shared.appUserID,
    email: currentEmail
)
```

## 5. Add the SwiftUI destination

`FeedbackListView` is designed for an existing app menu and `NavigationStack`:

```swift
struct SettingsMenu: View {
    let feedbackClient: BuildThisPleaseClient

    var body: some View {
        List {
            NavigationLink {
                BuildThisPlease.FeedbackListView(client: feedbackClient)
                    .buildThisPleaseTheme(.init(accent: .blue))
            } label: {
                Label("Feature requests", systemImage: "lightbulb")
            }
        }
        .navigationTitle("Settings")
    }
}
```

Use `BuildThisPlease.StandaloneFeedbackView(client:)` when BuildThisPlease must own its own `NavigationStack`.

Customize the accent and voted state without forking the SDK:

```swift
.buildThisPleaseTheme(.init(accent: .indigo, voteHighlight: .mint))
```

## 6. Verify before release

- The dashboard contains the exact Release Team ID and bundle identifier.
- The Release entitlement uses the `production` App Attest environment.
- The app uses `.production(baseURL: URL(string: "https://feedback.keinois.com")!)`.
- The app contains the correct publishable project key.
- A physical-device build can load, submit, vote, and reply.
- Notification recipients are correct in Project settings.
- No administrator or Cloudflare credentials are present in the app.

Run the package and example checks locally:

```bash
swift test
xcodebuild \
  -project Examples/BuildThisPleaseExample/BuildThisPleaseExample.xcodeproj \
  -scheme BuildThisPleaseExample \
  -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator' \
  -derivedDataPath .build/example-ci \
  CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
  ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=YES \
  build
```

## Dashboard operations

- Platform approval allows a developer to use BuildThisPlease but does not expose any customer workspace.
- Workspace invitations are bound to the invited email and grant access only after that identity authenticates and accepts.
- Workspace owners can invite administrators or read-only viewers.
- Workspace owners can export their data as JSON.
- Workspace deletion permanently removes every project and its feedback after exact-name confirmation. Export first.

For troubleshooting, CI, direct API usage, and an expanded launch checklist, see the [Integration guide](Documentation/Integration.md). Coding agents should also follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## Repository boundary

This repository intentionally contains only client-side code. Its example app is not included in the Swift package products and does not ship inside host applications. The private BuildThisPlease backend contains dashboard authorization, application-level tenant isolation, database migrations, deployment configuration, and production infrastructure.
